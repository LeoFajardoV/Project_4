CHURN PREDICTION WITH SPARK - PYTHON

About the Project

Music platforms such as youtube, spotify, deezer or another application in general that presents free and premium services for their clients, generally faces the problem of investigating or analyzing the abandonment or desertion rates of their services, either between their own products. or that they took other external services with better conditions. Therefore, it is a common and challenging problem that scientists and data analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. To this end, it seeks to minimize customer churn and churn by detecting in advance which customers are likely to cancel their subscription or resign their services.

This project is about the process of predicting unsubscribing customers using Spark as a tool to design the relevant features, then build machine learning models for the prediction. For this problem I use the Sparkify dataset provided by Udacity, for the realization of this project.
